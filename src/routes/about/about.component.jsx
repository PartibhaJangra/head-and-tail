      <h2>Why are the two sides of a coin known as heads and tails? </h2>
      <p>
        Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of
        throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it
        lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, heads or tails,
        sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of
        sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. The party who
        calls the side that is facing up when the coin lands wins.
